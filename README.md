# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Overview
The goal of this project was the learn at least four different sorting algorithms, the concept of Big O and how to evaluate time complexity of an algorithm, how to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input, and what a stable sorting algorithm is.
